Terraform & Ansible Based DevOps Projects
-----------------------------------------

This repository contains a collection of infrastructure automation and configuration management projects using Terraform and Ansible â€” two powerful tools in the DevOps ecosystem. These projects demonstrate how to automate cloud infrastructure provisioning and post-deployment configuration in an efficient, repeatable, and scalable manner.

Each project includes IaC (Infrastructure as Code) scripts, playbooks, inventories, and step-by-step documentation.

Project Highlights:
- Provisioning cloud infrastructure (AWS) using Terraform
- Creating reusable Terraform modules for networking, compute, and storage
- Automating software installation and configuration using Ansible
- Combining Terraform and Ansible for full-stack infrastructure setup
- Managing EC2 instances, security groups, VPCs, and IAM roles using Terraform
- Using Ansible for package installation, service configuration, and user management
- Ansible dynamic inventory with AWS EC2
- Executing Ansible playbooks remotely using SSH and keys

What I Learned:
- Writing efficient and reusable Terraform modules
- Managing infrastructure lifecycle using `terraform init`, `plan`, `apply`, and `destroy`
- Defining variables, outputs, and resource dependencies in Terraform
- Handling sensitive data using `terraform.tfvars` and environment variables
- Writing Ansible playbooks with roles, tasks, handlers, and variables
- Running Ansible against local and remote servers using static and dynamic inventories
- Using Terraform and Ansible together for complete infrastructure provisioning and configuration

Tools & Technologies Used:
- Terraform (with AWS provider)
- Ansible
- AWS (EC2, VPC, S3, IAM)
- Ubuntu/Linux
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code & CLI tools
- YAML, HCL, Shell scripting

This repository reflects my experience in infrastructure automation using industry-standard tools and best practices. The goal is to reduce manual effort, ensure consistency, and improve reliability when working with cloud environments.
